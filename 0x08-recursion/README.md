This directory holds the ALX projects on Recursion.
The project is still in development.

1. _puts_recursion: print a sting followed by a newline (similar to puts in the standard library)
2. _print_rev_recursion: print a string in reverse
3. _strlen_recursion: return the length of a string (similar to strlen in standard library)
4. factorial: return the factorial of a given number
5. int_pow_recursion: return the value of a given number 'x' raised to a given power 'y'.
6. _sqrt_recursion: return the natural square root of a given number.
7. is_prime_number: return 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
